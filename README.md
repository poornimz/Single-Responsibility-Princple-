Overview

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.

Why SRP Matters

Improves code maintainability

Enhances code readability

Makes debugging and testing easier

Reduces coupling between components

Conclusion

The Single Responsibility Principle helps in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. By ensuring that each class has only one reason to change, we improve software design and reduce the risk of unintended side effects when modifying code.
